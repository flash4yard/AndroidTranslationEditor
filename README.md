# Android Translation Editor

The Android Translation Editor for short "ATE" is an open source
software that allows users to easily translate native Android application resource files.

The main goal of this editor is to close the gap between app developers and their voluntary translators and this for FREE and without any limitations!

App developers like to provide their apps in as many languages as possible but usually they only speak their mother tongue and possibly another foreign language. 
There are users who are willing to volunteer help with the translations to improve their own experience and increase the reach of the entire project.

To provide an easy, standalone solution for this problem we have developed ATE. 
It is an easy to use editor which can be used by everyone - even by users who do not know anything about XML, as the application takes care of aspects like escaping special characters or insert not yet translated strings to existing resource files.


## Features
* Load multiple native Android application resource files
* Create empty translation file from a template
* Edit translations in a table
* Automatically escape special characters like ' or \
